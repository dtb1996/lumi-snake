                In this game you control a rare bioluminecscent snake breed, also known as the <i>Lumi-Snake</i>.
                The catch? The snake's visibility diminshes over time and the only way to replenish it is by eating food that is scattered around the level.
                Keep in mind that the snake is still moving even if it becomes invisible, so be sure to eat food quickly and avoid fading into the darkness.
